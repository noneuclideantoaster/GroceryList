                  Most songbirds. Larger birds do not have the correct beak
                  anatomy to crack the shell. Squirrels find safflower bitter,
                  and will leave feeders containing it alone.

                  Suet is boiled beef kidney fat. In the winter, it offers
                  extremely high amounts of fat and protein, which birds need to
                  survive harsh weather, lesser food resources, and the
                  consequences of molting. Suet comes with a variety of added
                  ingredients for different species of birds. Most birds will
                  eat and benefit from suet.

                  Mealworms are sold in a variety of fashions: either live, or
                  roasted/dried. They provide extremely important protein for
                  birds who supplement their diets with insects, and can be
                  taken back to nests for baby birds.

                  Many birds enjoy fresh and dried fruit. In the summer, leave
                  jams and ripe oranges out for orioles. Furthermore, if you
                  leave a rotting banana out in the open during the summer, many
                  hummingbirds will eat the fruit flies.

                  Birds require access to fresh water year-round. Consider
                  investing in a heated bird bath during winter months. Birds
                  further like moving water over stagnant, so consider investing
                  in a fountain or water jiggler.

                  Attaching a squirrel or raccoon baffle to a bird-feeding pole

                  Birds will unfortunately fly into glass windows when startled
                  or otherwise confused. These collisions frequently cause
                  serious internal injuries. Putting decorative decals on
                  windows, and ensure your feeder is far enough from your
                  windows, can help keep them safe.
